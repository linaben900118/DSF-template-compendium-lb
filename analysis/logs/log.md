### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now. Last week we learned about git hub and command line and how we can use programs as visual code to sync github in our machines. 

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. I would like to understand how can I use github with R to implement in my current project.

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. The content of the course is very clear.

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.I would like to access to the recorded sessions of tuesdays. Also, I would like to know more about latex, Do you have any material than you can share with me.
