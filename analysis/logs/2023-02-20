### Rose:
Two things that I enjoyed during the last session were first the discussion about documentation and then the exercise to develop a webpage using github. 
### Bud: 
I would like to start with the development of my web page as a researcher.
### Thorn: 
In the documentation, I am working this semester in the code of my thesis and I am discussing about good practices with my advisors and partners.

## Additional thought
I am trying to improve my organization skills in the documentation of my code, because that is the only way to remember how was the process that I did to write the final document.
