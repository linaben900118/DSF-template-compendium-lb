Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
During this week in FOSS training session we learned about project management. I consider that the most relevant topic was Project Governance, it is relevant to establish the team role and responsabilities at the beginning of the project. Also, it is relevant to document this information for future projects or any new member of the team


Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.
I am looking to learn about tools that I can apply for Research object organization because as a master student I dont have the experience in this field and I think it will be a valuabe field during my PhD
Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.
Do you have any specific example in Github/R Markdown of research object organization that we can use as a baseline for future projects.
