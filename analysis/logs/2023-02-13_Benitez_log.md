Two things that I enjoyed during the last session were first the discussion about data storgae and then the data planning talk
### Bud: 
I would like to start with a data plan during my PhD because that will help me to have more effectiveness and eficiency in my research.

In the data planning part, I am reading about real cases to understand the best way to develop my own data plan
