Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
I enjoyed the opportunity to learn about containers and have a better understanding about commercial cloud services 

Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.
I would like to use docker containers for R and run some geospatial packages in the analysis of environmental justice issues

Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on.
I attended only to the first day of container's camp, I'm reviewing the material of the other part of the course to understand more deeply the concepts
